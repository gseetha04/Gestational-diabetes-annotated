USPSTF Assessment of Magnitude of Net BenefitPregnant Persons at 24 Weeks of Gestation or AfterThe US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) concludes with moderate certainty that there is a <E>moderate net benefit</E>  to <C>screening for gestational diabetes at 24 weeks of gestation or after to improve maternal and fetal outcomes</C> .
"Definitions of Gestational DiabetesDuring pregnancy, <C>insulin resistance increases</C> , leading to <E>higher glucose intolerance and development of gestational diabetes</E>  in <CO>some pregnant persons</CO> ."
"Assessment of RiskSeveral factors <E>increase a person's risk for developing gestational diabetes</E> , including <C>obesity, increased maternal age, history of gestational diabetes, family history of diabetes, and belonging to a racial/ethnic group that is at increased risk for developing type 2 diabetes (Hispanic, Native American, South or East Asian, or Pacific Islander</C> descent).4,19,20 Factors associated with a <E>lower risk for developing gestational diabetes</E> include <C>age younger than 25 to 30 years, White race, a body mass index (BMI) of 25 or less (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared), no family history (in a first-degree relative) of diabetes, and no history of glucose intolerance or adverse pregnancy outcomes related to gestational diabetes</C>.21-23 The risk in different racial/ethnic groups may be due in part to social risk factors such as low socioeconomic status or structural racism, although these associations are not examined in the current evidence."
"Although a <C>higher BMI</C>  <E>increases the risk of gestational diabetes across racial/ethnic groups</E> , the association varies."
"In Asian American persons, the prevalence of gestational diabetes at a BMI of 22 to less than 25 is similar to the prevalence in Hispanic persons, non-Hispanic White persons, and Black persons with a higher (>28) BMI.24,25Screening Tests<C>Screening for gestational diabetes</C>  in <CO>asymptomatic persons</CO>  <A>involves either a 2-step (screening test followed by a diagnostic test) or 1-step (diagnostic test used for all patients) approach</A> ."
"In the US, a <A>a 2-step approach is commonly used</A>.8,26 <A>50-g oral glucose challenge test (OGCT)</A> is performed <CO>between 24 and 28 weeks of gestation</CO> in a <A>nonfasting state</A>."
"If the <CO>screening threshold is met or exceeded</CO> , <A>patients receive the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT)</A> ."
"During the OGTT, <A>a fasting glucose level is obtained, followed by administration of a 75-g or 100-g glucose load, then evaluation of glucose levels after 1, 2, and often 3 hours</A> ."
<CO>Pregnant persons at 24 weeks of gestation or after</CO> \n<A>Screen for gestational diabetes</A> .Grade: BPregnant persons before 24 weeks of gestationThe evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms for screening for gestational diabetes.
"Screen: <CO>If the person is pregnant and is at least 24 weeks of gestation</CO> , <A>screen for gestational diabetes by using 1 of several methods:A 2-step process that involves a screening test (oral glucose challenge test) followed by a diagnostic test (oral glucose tolerance test).</A> "
"<A>A diagnosis of gestational diabetes</A>  is made when <CO>2 or more glucose values fall at or above the specified glucose thresholds</CO> .27In the <S>1-step approach</S> , <A>a 75-g glucose load is administered after a fasting glucose level is obtained, and plasma glucose levels are evaluated after 1 and 2 hours</A> ."
"The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends <A>testing between 24 and 28 weeks of gestation</A> .1 <CO>Pregnant persons whose first prenatal visit happens after 28 weeks of gestation (ie, late entry into prenatal care)</CO>  should be<A>screened as soon as possible</A> ."
"Potential Preventable BurdenBetween 2006 and 2016, there was an absolute increase of 3.6% in the prevalence of gestational diabetes.7 <C>Pregnant persons with gestational diabetes</C>  are at <E>increased risk for maternal and fetal complications</E>  and may <S>benefit</S>  from <A>early identification and treatment</A> ."
"They are also at increased risk for developing type 2 diabetes after pregnancy.29 <CO>Pregnant persons who are diagnosed with gestational diabetes before 24 weeks of gestation</CO>  <E>may be at even greater risk for maternal and fetal complications</E> .29Potential Harms<S>Potential harms</S>  of <C>screening for gestational diabetes</C>  include <E>psychological harms (anxiety, depression), intensive medical interventions (induction of labor, cesarean delivery, or admission to the neonatal intensive care unit [NICU]), and negative hospital experiences related to labeling (reduction in breastfeeding and fewer newborns staying in the mothers room) that may be associated with a diagnosis of gestational diabetes</E> ."
"Race/ethnicity was fairly diverse in several studies, although 2 of the largest studies with treatment at 24 weeks of gestation or after enrolled large proportions of White (75%) and Chinese (97%) persons.29,34,37, <C>Treatment of gestational diabetes</C> at <CO>24 weeks of gestation or after</CO> was associated with <E>decreased risk of primary cesarean delivery (relative risk [RR], 0.70 [95% CI, 0.54-0.91]; absolute risk difference [ARD], 5.3%; 3 trials) and preterm deliveries, although find- ings for the latter are not statistically significant (RR, 0.75 [95% CI, 0.56-1.01]; ARD, 2.3%; 4 trials)</E> .29,34 <C>Treatment of gestational diabetes</C> was <E>not associated with reduced risk of preeclampsia</E> in the included studies (RR, 0.99 [95% CI, 0.46-2.16]; 6 trials).29 Additionally, <C>treatment</C> was <E>not associated with reduced risk of gestational hypertension (2 trials), total cesarean deliveries (8 trials), emergency cesarean deliveries (1 trial), induction of labor (5 trials), or maternal birth trauma (2 trials)</E>.29,34For fetal/neonatal outcomes, <C>treatment of gestational diabetes at 24 weeks of gestation or after</C> was <E>associated with reduced risk of shoulder dystocia, macrosomia, LGA infabts, birth injury (eg, fracture or nerve palsies), NICU admissions</E> (RR, 0.73 [95% CI, 0.53-0.99]; ARD, 2%; 5 trials).29,34 No association was found for several outcomes, including mortality (stillbirth, neona- tal, or perinatal), respiratory distress syndrome, hypoglycemia (any or clinical), and hyperbilirubinemia."
"One study found that <C>gestational diabetes diagnosis and labeling</C>  may be associated with <E>higher rates of cesarean delivery</E> .29,34Harms associated with the treatment of gestational diabetes were evaluated in 13 trials (11 RCTs and 2 nonrandomized clinical trials; n = 4235).29,34 <C>Treatment at 24 weeks of gestation or after</C>  was <E>not associated with an increased risk for severe maternal hypoglycemia, low birth weight, or small for gestational age infants</E> ."
"<C>Treatment of gestational diabetes</C>  was associated with a <E>reduced risk of macrosomia (>4000 g)</E>  (RR, 0.53 [95% CI, 0.41 to 0.68]) but <E>no difference in the risk of total number of cesarean deliveries</E>  (RR, 0.95 [95% CI, 0.83 to 1.08]).29,34 This suggests that a <CO>small proportion of pregnant persons</CO>  may <A>undergo cesarean delivery</A>  because of <C>gestational diabetes diagnosis alone</C> ."
<CO>Pregnant persons who are unable to produce adequate insulin to overcome the increase in insulin resistance seen in pregnancy</CO>  develop <E>glucose intolerance and gestational diabetes</E> .
"The USPSTF found that <C>several screening tests (OGCT, OGTT, fasting plasma glucose) and strategies (1- vs 2-step approach)</C>  can <E>accurately detect gestational diabetes</E>  and does not recommend any single specific test."
"<CO>Type 1 diabetes</CO>  (<C>due to autoimmune b-cell destruction</C> , usually leading to <E>absolute insulin deficiency</E> )2."
<E>Gestational diabetes mellitus</E>  (<C>diabetes diagnosed in the second or third trimester of pregnancy that was not clearly overt diabetes prior to gestation</C> )4.
"Occasionally, <C>patients with type 2 diabetes</C>  may <E>present with DKA</E>  (6), particularly ethnic minorities (7)."
"<CO>In both type 1 and type 2 diabetes</CO> , <C>various genetic and environmental factors</C>  can <E>result in the progressive loss of b-cell mass and/or function that manifests clinically as hyperglycemia</E> ."
"Once <C>hyperglycemia</C>  occurs, <CO>patients with all forms of diabetes</CO>  are at <S>risk</S>  for <E>developing the same chronic complications</E> , although rates of progression may differ."
It is now clear from studies of <CO>first-degree relatives of patients with type 1 diabetes</CO>  that the <C>persistent presence of two or more islet autoantibodies</C>  is an almost certain <S>predictor</S>  of <E>clinical hyperglycemia and diabetes</E> .
"<C>Type 2 diabetes</C>  is associated with<E> insulin secretory defects related to infiammation and metabolic stress among other contributors, including genetic factors.</E> "
The <A>same tests may be used to screen</A> for and <C>diagnose diabetes and to detect individuals with prediabetes</C> (Table 2.2 and Table 2.5).
<A>Fasting and 2-Hour Plasma Glucose The FPG and 2-h PG</A> may be used to <C>diagnose diabetes</C> (Table 2.2).
"A1CRecommendations2.1	To <E>avoid misdiagnosis or missed diagnosis,</E>  <A>the A1C test should be performed using a method that is certied by the NGSP and stan- dardized to the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) assay</A> ."
"Race/Ethnicity/Hemoglobinopathies<C>Hemoglobin variants</C>  can <E>interfere with the measurement of A1C</E> , although most assays in use in theU.S. are unaffected by the most common variants."
"<CO>For patients with a hemoglobin variant but normal red blood cell turnover, such as those with the sickle cell trait</CO>, <A>an A1C assay without interference from hemoglobin variants should be used</A>."
"<CO>African Americans</CO> <C>heterozygous for the common hemoglobin variant HbS</C> may have, for any given level of mean glycemia, <E>lower A1C by about 0.3% than those without the trait</E> (20)."
"Another genetic variant, <C>X-linked glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase G202A</C> , carried by 11% of African Americans, was associated with a <E>decrease in A1C</E>  of about 0.8% in homozygous men and 0.7% in homozygous women compared with those without the variant (21)."
"Even in the <CO>absence of hemoglobin variants</CO>, <E>A1C levels <MD>may</MD> vary</E> with <C>race/ ethnicity</C> independently of glycemia (22-24)."
"For example, <CO>African Americans</CO>  may have <E>higher <C>A1C levels</C>  than non- Hispanic whites with similar fasting and postglucose load glucose levels</E>  (25), and <C>A1C levels</C>  may be <E>higher for a given mean glucose concentration</E>  when <A>measured with continuous glucose monitoring</A>  (26)."
"<C>Be- cause of the potential for preanalytic variability,</C> <A> it is critical that samples for plasma glucose be spun and separated immediately after they are drawn.</A> "
TYPE 1 DIABETESRecommendations<A>Screening for type 1 diabetes risk with a panel of islet autoantibodies</A>  is currently recommended in the <CO>setting of a research trial or can be offered as an option for rst-degree family members of a proband with type 1 diabetes</CO> .
"Although patients are not typically obese when they present with <E>type 1 diabetes</E> , <C>obesity</C>  is increasingly common in the general population and there is evidence that it may also be a <S>risk factor</S>  for <E>type 1 diabetes</E> ."
"<CO>People with type 1 diabetes</CO> are also prone to other <E>autoimmune disorders such as Hashimoto thyroiditis, Graves disease, celiac disease, Addison disease, vitiligo, auto- immune hepatitis, myasthenia gravis, and pernicious anemia</E> (see Section 4 ""Comprehensive Medical Evaluation and Assessment of Comorbidities,"" https://doi.org/10.2337/dc20-S004)."
Individuals with <C>autoantibody-negative type 1 diabetes</C>  of <CO>African or Asian ancestry</CO>  may suffer from <E>episodic DKA and exhibit varying degrees of insulin deficiency between episodes</E> .
"Multiple studies indicate that <C>measuring islet autoantibodies in individuals genetically at risk for type 1 diabetes (e.g., relatives of those with type 1 diabetes or indi- viduals from the general population with type 1 diabetes-associated genetic factors)</C>  <E>identifies individuals who may develop type 1 diabetes</E>  (9)."
"Indeed, the <E>risk of type 1 diabetes increases</E>  as the <C>number of relevant autoantibodies detected increases</C>  (43-45)."
"PREDIABETES AND TYPE 2 DIABETES2.13 <A>Risk based screening for prediabetes and/or type 2 diabetes should be considered after the onset of puberty or after 10 years of age, whichever occurs earlier</A>, <CO>in children and adolescents with overweight (BMI >85th percen- tile) or obesity (BMI >95th per- centile) and who have one or more risk factor for diabetes</CO>."
"<CO>If results are normal</CO>, <A>testing should be repeated at a minimum of 3-year intervals, with consideration of more frequent testing depending on initial results and risk status</A>."
"It should be noted that theTable 2.4<C>Risk-based screening for type 2 diabetes or prediabetes</C> in <CO>asymptomatic children and adolescents in a clinical setting</CO> (163)<A>Testingshould be considered in youth* who have overweight (>85th percentile) or obesity (>95th percentile) and who have one or more additional risk factors based on the strength of their association with diabetes</A>:<CO>Maternal history of diabetes or GDM during the childs gestation</CO> A<CO>Family history of type 2 diabetes in first- or second-degree relative</CO> A<CO>Race/ethnicity (Native American, African American, Latino, Asian American, Pacic Islander)</CO> A<CO>Signs of insulin resistance or conditions associated with insulin resistance (acanthosis nigricans, hypertension, dyslipidemia, polycystic ovary syndrome, or small-for-gestational- age birth weight)</CO> BGDM, gestational diabetes mellitus."
"<CO>If tests are normal</CO> , <A>repeat testing at a minimum of 3-year intervals, or more frequently if BMI is increasing</A> , is recommended."
Those with an <C>A1C range of 6.0- 6.5% (42-48 mmol/mol)</C>  had a <E>5-year risk of developing diabetes between 25% and 50%</E>  and a relative risk 20 times higher compared with A1C of 5.0% (31 mmol/mol) (49).
"Similar to those with IFG and/or IGT, <CO>individuals with A1C of 5.7-6.4% (39-47 mmol/mol)</CO>  should be <A>informed of their increased risk for diabetes and CVD and counseled about effective strategies to lower their risks</A>  (see Section 3 ""Prevention or Delay of Type 2 Di- abetes,"" https://doi.org/10.2337/dc20- S003)."
"Similar to glucose measurements, the continuum of risk is curvilinear, so as <C>A1C rises</C> , the <E>diabetes risk rises disproportionately</E>  (49)."
"<A>Aggressive interventions and vigilant follow-up should be pursued for those considered at very high risk (e.g., those with A1C .6.0% [42 mmol/mol])</A>."
<C>Excess weight</C>  itself causes <E>some degree of insulin resistance</E> .
"<E>DKA</E>  seldom occurs spontaneously in type 2 diabetes; when seen, it usually arises in association with the <C>stress of another illness such as infection or with the use of certain drugs (e.g., corticosteroids, atypical antipsychotics, and sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors)</C>  (53,54)."
"The <E>risk of developing type 2 diabetes</E>  <S>increases </S> with <C>age, obesity, and lack of physical activity.</C> "
"After 5.3 years of follow-up, <E>CVD risk factors were modestly but significantly improved</E>  with <C>intensive treatment compared with routine care</C> , but the <E>incidence of first CVD events or mortality was not significantly different between the groups</E>  (48)."
"Community ScreeningIdeally, <A>testing should be carried out within a health care setting because of the need for follow-up and treatment</A>."
CYSTIC FIBROSIS-RELATED DIABETESRecommendations<A>Annual screening for cystic brosisrelated diabetes (CFRD) with an oral glucose tolerance test</A>  should begin by <CO>age 10 years in all patients with cystic brosis not previously diagnosed with CFRD</CO> .
B<CO>Patients with cystic brosis related diabetes</CO>  should be <A>treated with insulin to attain individualized glycemic goals</A> .
"A<CO>Beginning 5 years after the diagnosis of cystic brosisrelated diabetes</CO> , <A>annual monitoring for complications of diabetes is recommended</A> ."
"<C>Diabetes in this population, compared with individuals with type 1 or type 2 diabetes</C> , is associated with <E>worse nutritional status, more severe infiammatory lung disease, and greater mortality.</E> "
<C>Genetically determined b-cell function and insulin resistance associated with infection and infiammation</C>  may also contribute to the <E>development of CFRD</E> .
EThe <A>oral glucose tolerance test</A> is the preferred test to make a <C>diagnosis of posttransplantation diabetes mellitus</C>.
"Most studies have reported that <C>transplant patients with hyperglycemia and PTDM after transplantation</C>  have <E>higher rates of rejection, infection, and rehospitalization</E>  (89,91,96)."
<CO>Those with previously poor control or with persistent hyperglycemia</CO>  should <A>continue insulin with frequent home self-monitoring of blood glucose to determine when insulin dose reductions may be needed and when it may be appropriate to switch to non- insulin agents</A> .
"<A>Drug dose adjustments</A>  may be required because of decreases in the <C>glomerular filtration rate,</C>  a relatively common complication in transplant patients."
"<A>Thiazolidinediones</A>  have been used successfully in <CO>patients with liver and kidney transplants</CO> , but <S>side effects</S>  include <E>fiuid retention, heart failure, and osteopenia</E>  (98,99)."
<A>Well-designed intervention trials examining the efficacy and safety of these and other antihyperglycemic agents </A> in <CO>patients with PTDM</CO>  are needed.
MONOGENIC DIABETES SYNDROMESRecommendations<CO>All children diagnosed with diabetes in the rst 6 months of life</CO>  should <A>have immediate genetic testing for neonatal diabetes</A> .
A<CO>Children and those diagnosed in early adulthood who have diabetes not characteristic of type 1 or type 2 diabetes that occurs in successive generations</CO>  (suggestive of an autosomal dominant pattern of inheri- tance) should <A>have genetic test- ing for maturity-onset diabetes of the young</A> .
"AIn both instances, <A>consultation with a center specializing in diabetes genetics is recommended to understand the signicance of these mutations and how best to approach further evaluation, treatment, and genetic counseling</A> ."
"E<C>Monogenic defects</C>  that cause <E>b-cell dysfunction, such as neonatal diabetes and MODY</E> , represent a small fraction of patients with diabetes (,5%)."
<C>patients with KATP-related neonatal diabetes</C>  will exhibit <E>improved glycemic control</E>  when <A>treated with high-dose oral sulfonylureas instead of insulin</A> .
"<C>Insulin gene (INS) mutations</C>  are the second most common cause of <E>permanent neonatal diabetes</E> , and, while <A>intensive insulin management is currently the preferred treatment strategy</A> , there are important genetic counseling considerations, as most of the mutations that cause diabetes are dominantly inherited."
"Clinically, <C>patients with GCK-MODY</C>  exhibit <E>mild, stable, fasting hyperglycemia</E>  and <A>do not require antihyperglycemic therapy except sometimes during pregnancy</A> ."
<C>Mutations or deletions in HNF1B</C>  are associated with <E>renal cysts and uterine malformations (renal cysts and diabetes [RCAD] syndrome)</E> .
"Additionally, <C>diagnosis</C>  can lead to <E>identification of other affected family members</E> ."
"<A>A diagnosis of MODY</A>  should be considered in <CO>individuals who have atypical diabetes and multiple family members with diabetes not characteristic of type 1 or type 2 diabetes,</CO>  although admittedly ""atypical diabetes"" is becoming increasingly difficult to precisely define in the absence of a definitive set of tests for either type of diabetes (104-110)."
"In most cases, the <CO>presence of autoantibodies for type 1 diabetes</CO> <E> precludes further testing for monogenic diabetes,</E>  but the presence of autoantibodies in patients with monogenic diabetes has been reported (111)."
"<CO>Individuals in whom monogenic diabetes is suspected</CO>  should be <A>referred to a specialist for further evaluation if available, and consultation is available from several centers</A> ."
"It is critical to <A>correctly diagnose one of the monogenic forms of diabetes</A>  because <C>these patients may be incorrectly diagnosed with type 1 or type 2 diabetes</C> ,<E> leading to suboptimal, even potentially harmful, treatment regimens and delays in diagnosing other family members</E>  (114)."
<A>Genetic counseling is recommended to ensure that affected individuals understand the patterns of inheritance and the importance of a correct diagnosis</A> .
"<A>The diagnosis of monogenic diabetes should be considered in children and adults diagnosed with diabetes in early adulthood</A> with the following findings: <CO>Diabetes diagnosed within the first 6 months of life (with occasional cases presenting later, mostly INS and ABCC8 mutations) (103,116) Diabetes without typical features of type 1 or type 2 diabetes (negative diabetes-associated autoantibodies, non- obese, lacking other metabolic features especially with strong family history of diabetes) Stable, mild fasting hyperglycemia (100-150 mg/dL [5.5-8.5 mmol/L]),stable A1C between 5.6 and 7.6%(between 38 and 60 mmol/mol), especially if nonobese</CO> PANCREATIC DIABETES OR DIABETES IN THE CONTEXT OF DISEASE OF THE EXOCRINE PANCREAS <C>Pancreatic diabetes</C> includes both structural and functional loss of glucose- normalizing insulin secretion in the context of exocrine pancreatic dysfunction and is commonly <E>misdiagnosed as type 2 diabetes</E>."
"<C>Hyperglycemia due to general pancreatic dysfunction</C>  has been called ""<E>type 3c diabetes</E> "" and, more recently, diabetes in the context of disease of the exocrine pancreas has been termedpancreoprivic diabetes (1)."
"In the context of pancreatectomy, <A>islet autotransplantation can be done</A> <C>to retain insulin secretion</C> (123,124)."
"<CO>In some cases</CO> , this can lead to <E>insulin independence</E> ."
"<CO>In others</CO>, it may <E>decrease insulin requirements</E> (125)."
GESTATIONAL DIABETES MELLITUSRecommendations<A>Test for undiagnosed prediabetes and diabetes at the first prenatal visit</A> <CO>in those with risk factors using standard diagnostic criteria</CO> .
B<A>Test for gestational diabetes mellitus at 2428 weeks of gestation</A>  <CO>in pregnant women not previously found to have diabetes</CO> .
"A<A>Test women with gestational diabetes mellitus</A> <CO>for prediabetes or diabetes at 412 weeks postpartum</CO>, using the 75-g oral glucose tolerance test and clinically appropriate nonpregnancy diagnostic criteria."
B<CO>Women with a history of gestational diabetes mellitus</CO>  should <A>have lifelong screening for the development of diabetes or pre- diabetes at least every 3 years</A> .
B<CO>Women with a history of gestational diabetes mellitus found to have prediabetes</CO>  should <A>receive intensive lifestyle interventions and/or metformin to prevent diabetes</A> .
"<C>Because of the number of pregnant women with undiagnosed type 2 diabetes</C>, <A>it is reasonable to test women with risk factors for type 2 diabetes (133) (Table 2.3) at their initial prenatal visit, using standard diagnostic criteria (Table 2.2)</A>."
"As effective prevention interventions are available (138,139), <CO>women diagnosed with GDM</CO>  should <A>receive lifelong screening for pre- diabetes to allow interventions to reduce diabetes risk and for type 2 diabetes to allow treatment at the earliest possible time</A>  (140)."
"Diagnosis<C>GDM</C>  carries <S>risks</S>  for the <E>mother, fetus, and neonate</E> ."
"The Hyperglycemia and Adverse Pregnancy Outcome (HAPO) study (141), a large-scale multinational cohort study completed by more than 23,000 pregnant women, demonstrated that <S>risk</S>  of <E>adverse maternal, fetal, and neonatal outcomes continuously increased</E>  as a function of <C>maternal glycemia at 24-28 weeks of gestation, even within ranges previously considerednormal for pregnancy</C> ."
"This <C>one-step strategy</C>  was anticipated to <E>significantly increase the incidence of GDM (from 5-6% to 15- 20%)</E> , primarily because only one abnormal value, not two, became sufficient to make the diagnosis (142)."
"A recent follow-up study of women participating in a blinded study of pregnancy OGTTs found that 11 years after their pregnancies, <CO>women who would have been diagnosed with GDM by the one-step approach</CO> , as compared with those without, were at 3.4-fold higher risk of <E>developing prediabetes and type 2 diabetes</E>  and <E>had children with a higher risk of obesity and increased body fat</E> , suggesting that the larger group of <CO>women identified by the one-step approach</CO>  would <E>benefit from increased screening for diabetes and prediabetes that would accompany a history of GDM</E> (144)."
"Table 2.7Screening for and diagnosis of <C>GDM</C> <C>One-step strategy</C> <A>Perform a 75-g OGTT, with plasma glucose measurement when patient is fasting and at 1 and 2 h, at 2428 weeks of gestation</A>  in <CO>women not previously diagnosed with diabetes</CO> ."
<A>The OGTT should be performed in the morning after an overnight fast of at least 8 h</A>.
"<A>Additional well-designed clinical studies</A> are needed <C>to determine the optimal intensity of monitoring and treatment of women with GDM diagnosed by the one-step strategy</C> (147,148)."
The panel recommended a<A> two- step approach to screening that used a 1-h 50-g glucose load test (GLT) followed by a 3-h 100-g OGTT</A>  for those <CO>who screened positive.</CO> 
"The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommends any of the <A>commonly used thresholds of 130, 135, or 140 mg/dL</A>  for the <C>1-h 50-g GLT</C>  (150)."
"<C>Treatment of higher-threshold maternal hyperglycemia, as identified by the two-step approach</C> , <E>reduces rates of neonatal macrosomia, large-for- gestational-age births (153), and shoulder dystocia, without increasing small-for- gestational-age births</E> ."

<S>Evidence</S>   <C>Combined oral contraceptive use</C>  by <CO>women with type 1 diabetes</CO>  <E>does not affect their glycemic control or increase their risk of end-organ injury</E>  (217-219).
We suggest<CO> women with type 1 diabetes</CO> <A> be screened for postpartum thyroiditis with a TSH at 3 and 6 months postpartum</A> .
SUMMARY OF RECOMMENDATION AND EVIDENCE    The USPSTF <A>recommends screening for abnormal blood glucose as part of cardiovascular risk assessment in adults</A>  <CO>aged 40 to 70 years who are overweight or obese</CO> .
Recommendation: The USPSTF <A>recommends screening for abnormal blood glucose as part of cardiovascular risk assessment</A>  in <CO>adults aged 40 to 70 years who are overweight or obese</CO> .
"<S>Modifiable cardiovascular risk factors</S>  include <C>abnormal blood glucose, hypertension, hyperlipidemia or dyslipidemia, smoking, overweight and obesity, physical inactivity, and an unhealthy diet</C> ."
Population<CO>Adults aged 40 to 70 y who are overweight or obese</CO> Recommendation<A>Screen for abnormal blood glucose</A> .
<C>Treatment and Interventions</C> <A>Effective behavioral interventions combine counseling on a healthful diet and physical activity and involve multiple contacts over extended periods</A> .
The USPSTF previously found <S>adequate evidence</S>  that <C>intensive behavioral counseling interventions</C>  for <CO>persons at increased risk for CVD</CO>  have <E>moderate benefits in lowering CVD risk</E> .
"Populations in which these <S>benefits</S>  have been shown include <CO>persons who are obese or overweight and have hypertension, hyperlipidemia or dyslipidemia, and/or IFG or IGT</CO> ."
<S>Harms</S>  of <C>Early Detection and Treatment</C>     The USPSTF found that <C>measuring blood glucose</C>  is associated with <E>short-term anxiety but not long-term psychological harms</E> .
"The <S>harms</S>  of <C>drug therapy for the prevention of diabetes</C>  are <E>small to moderate</E> , <CO>depending on the drug and dosage used</CO> ."
"<C>Persons who have a family history of diabetes, have a history of gestational diabetes or polycystic ovarian syndrome, or are members of certain racial/ ethnic groups (that is, African Americans, American In- dians or Alaskan Natives, Asian Americans, Hispanics or Latinos, or Native Hawaiians or Pacific Islanders)</C>  may be at <E>increased risk for diabetes at a younger age or at a lower body mass index</E> ."
"Although <S>direct evidence</S>  that <C>preventing a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes</C>  results in <E>improved health outcomes</E>  is <S>limited</S> , <C>primary prevention</C>  that reduces the chances of a diagnosis may <E>reduce the adverse consequences of disease management</E> ."
Cohort and modeling studies suggest that <A>re- screening every 3 years may be a reasonable approach for adults with normal blood glucose levels</A> (3-7).
"Other Approaches to Prevention    Because <C>overweight and obesity, physical inactivity, abnormal lipid levels, high blood pressure, and smoking</C>  are <S>all modifiable risk factors</S>  for <E>cardiovascular events</E> , the USPSTF <A>recommends screening and appropriate interventions for these conditions</A>  (available at www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org)."
"The USPSTF recommends <C>screening for obesity in adults</C>  and offering or referring those with a <CO>body mass index of 30 kg/m2 or greater</CO>  to <A>intensive, multicomponent behavioral interventions.</A> "
The USPSTF recommends offering or referring <CO>adults who are overweight (body mass index >25 kg/ m2) and have additional cardiovascular risk factors</CO>  to <A>intensive behavioral counseling interventions to promote a healthful diet and physical activity for CVD prevention.</A> 
The USPSTF <A>recommends screening for lipid disorders</A>  in <CO>men aged 35 years or older and women aged 45 years or older who are at increased risk for coronary heart disease</CO> .
The USPSTF also recommends <A>screening for hypertension</A> in adults aged 18 years or older and that clinicians ask all adults about tobacco use and provide tobacco cessation interventions to those who use tobacco products.
Useful Resources    The Community Preventive Services Task Force recommends <A>combined diet and physical activity promotion programs</A> <CO>for persons who are at increased risk for type 2 diabetes</CO>.
<A>Clinical trials and additional modeling studies</A> are needed <E>to better elucidate the optimal frequency of screening and the age at which to start screening</E>.
"<A>More U.S. data are also needed on</A>  the <S>benefits and harms</S>  of <C>lifestyle interventions and medical treatments</C>  for screen-detected IFG, IGT, and diabetes over a longer follow-up period."
"<C>Uncontrolled diabetes</C> is a <S>leading cause</S> of <E>cardiovascular mortality and morbidity and may also result in other complications, such as vision loss, renal failure, and amputation</E>."
The USPSTF determined that there is adequate evidence that <C>lifestyle interventions</C> <E> can prevent or delay progression to type 2 diabetes.</E> 
"<C>Metformin, thiazolidinediones, and aglucosidase inhibitors</C>  were all found to be <E>effective in preventing or delaying progression</E> ."
"The Diabetes Prevention Program (11), conducted in the United States in 3234 participants, found that an <C>intensive lifestyle modification intervention</C>  was <E>associated with better quality of life at 3-year follow-up</E> ."
"<C>Intensive glycemic control</C>  was <E>associated with reduced risk for nonfatal myocardial infarction and microvascular disease but increased risk for severe hypoglycemia</E>  (15, 16)."
"However, a <E>consistent benefit of stroke reduction</E>  was found in study groups with <C>intensive versus standard blood pressure control</C>  (23, 24)."
The ACCORD study (25) found that <C>intensive lipid-lowering therapy</C>  was <E>associated with reduced risk for a composite cardiovascular outcome</E>  <CO>in men with diabetes</CO>  but <E>possible harm in women</E>  (interaction P = 0.01) (25).
One trial found that <C>acarbose</C>  was associated with <E>higher risk for withdrawal because of adverse events compared with placebo</E>  (42).
"One large trial found that <C>nateglinide</C>  (43) was associated with <E>increased risk for hypoglycemia compared with placebo</E>  (RR, 1.73 [CI, 1.57 to 1.92]); further, <C>valsartan</C>  was associated (44) with <E>hypotension related adverse events</E>  (RR, 1.16 [CI, 1.11 to 1.23])."
"One trial (45) found that <C>rosiglitazone</C>  was associated with <E>increased risk for congestive heart failure</E>  (HR, 7.04 [CI, 1.6 to 31]), but the <S>estimate was imprecise</S> ."
UPDATE OF PREVIOUS USPSTF RECOMMENDATION    This is an update of the 2008 USPSTF recommendation statement in which the USPSTF recommended <A>screening for diabetes</A>  in <C>asymptomatic adults with hypertension </C> (defined as sustained blood pressure of>135/80 mm Hg) (B recommendation).
RECOMMENDATIONS OF OTHERS    The American Diabetes Association (46) recommends <A>screening for diabetes</A>  in <CO>adults aged 45 years or older</CO>  and screening in persons with multiple risk factors regardless of age.
(27) found that <C>maternal plasma glucose concentration during pregnancy (measured 2 h after a 75-g load)</C>  had a continuous association with <E>adverse pregnancy outcomes (LGA and cesarean section)</E> .
"(16) found <E>risk of severe macrosomia, neonatal hypoglycemia, and hyperbilirubinemia increased</E>  with <C>increasing number of abnormal glucose values according to current American Diabetes Association cut points</C>  (2,5) among <CO>women who did not meet National Diabetes Data Group criteria for GDM</CO>  (31)."
<C>Adiposity in offspring at 5-7 years of age</C>  was significantly associated with <E>measures of maternal glycemia (50-g glucose challenge and/or 100-g OGTT) during pregnancy</E> .
"<E>Fetal macrosomia (LGA)</E>  is a major indicator of the effects of <C>hyperglycemia during pregnancy</C>  (12,35,36)."
"<S>Long-term risks</S> associated with <C>fetal macrosomia</C> in <CO>infants of women with GDM</CO> (independent of confounders) include <E>childhood overweight (43,44) and metabolic factors that may increase risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD)</E> (45)."
<C>Measuring FPG alone</C>  <E>identified 8.3% of the cohort as having GDM</E> .
"In addition to the outcomes used to deter- mine the thresholds, there were strong associations between <C>maternal glucose</C>  and <E>preeclampsia </E> (ORs 1.40 -1.57) and shoulder dystocia and/or birth injury (1.30 -1.43)."
"The <E>frequency of birth weight, C-peptide, or percent infant body fat >90th percentile was approximately twofold greater</E>  when <C>any of the glucose values were greater than or equal to the threshold</C> ."
"The <E>frequency of preeclampsia was twofold higher</E>  when <C>one or more glucose values met or exceeded threshold</C> , and <E>frequencies of preterm delivery and primary cesarean section were >45% higher</E> ."
"In both randomized controlled trials, <C>treatment, achieved primarily by diet/lifestyle modification</C> , resulted in <E>reduced birth weight and frequency of LGA births and pre- eclampsia</E> ."
"As <C>ongoing epidemics of obesity and diabetes</C>  result in more type 2 diabetes in young women, <E>the number who are undiagnosed (before pregnancy) is increasing</E>  (49,50)."
"IADPSG Consensus Panel members favored <A>use of any available certified laboratory measure of glucose (FPG, random plasma glucose, or A1C)</A> <C>for initial detection of possible cases</C>."
<A>An expert committee recently recommended that an A1C value >6.5% (measured in a laboratory standardized/aligned with the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial [DCCT]/UK Prospective Diabetes Study [UKPDS] assay) be used for diagnosis of diabetes outside pregnancy</A>  (55).
It is desirable to <A>detect overt diabetes in pregnancy as early as possible</A> <E>to provide an opportunity to optimize pregnancy outcome</E>.
"However, <CO>if enrollment is at 24 weeks' gestation or later and overt diabetes is not found</CO> , <A>the initial test should be followed by a 75-g OGTT</A> ."
It was recognized that any <C>assessment of glycemia in early pregnancy</C>  would also result in <E>detection of milder degrees of hyperglycemia short of overt diabetes</E> .
"Recently, it was reported that <C>higher first trimester FPG levels (lower than those diagnostic of diabetes)</C>  are associated with <E>increased risks of later diagnosis of GDM and adverse pregnancy outcomes</E>  (57)."

"<A>Universal early testing in populations with a high prevalence of type 2 diabetes </A> is recommended, <CO>especially if metabolic testing in this age-group is not commonly performed outside of pregnancy</CO> ."
<A>Well-designed studies should be conducted to determine whether it is beneficial and cost-effective to perform an OGTT</A> <CO>in women who do not have overt diabetes at early testing but have indeterminate nondiagnostic results</CO>.
<A>Glucose testing early in pregnancy</A> <CO> to detect overt diabetes </CO> and again with a<C> 75-g OGTT at 24 -28 weeks' of gestation in all pregnancies not already diagnosed with overt diabetes or GDM </C> by early testing represents fundamental <E>changes in strategies for detection and diagnosis of hyperglycemia in pregnancy.</E> 
"Clinical Preventive Service RecommendationDiabetes Screening, AdultsType 2 Diabetes, AdultsThe AAFP <A>recommends screening for type 2 diabetes</A>  <CO>in adults aged 40 to 70 years who have overweight or obesity</CO> ."
"The AAFP also agrees that there is insufficient evidence for screening prior to 24 weeks gestation.1The AAFP has also reviewed the US Preventive Services Task Force evidence report and agrees that <CO>nonpregnant adults aged 40 to 70 who have obesity or overweight</CO> <A>be screened for type 2 diabetes as part of risk assessment for cardiovascular disease.2</A>  <A>Screening in this setting refers to measuring fasting plasma glucose, HbA1c level, or using an oral glucose tolerance test</A>."
"While AAFP acknowledges that <E>diabetes</E> , like all chronic conditions, exists on a continuum and that <C>insulin resistance</C>  is a <S>risk factor</S>  for developing <E>diabetes</E> , the <S>current evidence</S>  <E>does not show improvement in long term health outcomes</E>  for screening for pre<E>diabetes</E>  in <CO>adults who have obesity or overweight</CO> ."
"The evidence did show a <E>reduction in the incidence of diabetes</E> in individuals at risk for diabetes who <C>received intense lifestyle interventions or metformin</C>, however there was not an associated improvement in health outcomes."
"<C>Lifestyle interventions to prevent progression for prediabetes to diabetes</C> are effective in <E>reducing weight, blood pressure and cholesterol</E> and would likely be recommended and beneficial for these individuals, even in the absence of screening."
